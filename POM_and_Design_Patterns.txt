## Page Object Model (POM) and Design Patterns in this Project

This project appears to follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for its Selenium test automation.

### Page Object Model (POM)

The Page Object Model is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for UI elements within an application. The advantages of POM are:
*   **Code Reusability:** Page Objects can be reused across multiple test cases.
*   **Maintainability:** If the UI changes, only the Page Object needs to be updated, not every test case.
*   **Readability:** Test cases become cleaner and easier to understand as they interact with Page Objects rather than directly with UI elements.

In this project, `Login.java` and `RegisterPage.java` likely represent the "Page Objects".
*   `Login.java`: This class would contain methods and elements related to the login page (e.g., username field, password field, login button, login method).
*   `RegisterPage.java`: This class would contain methods and elements related to the registration page (e.g., various input fields, register button, registration method).

The test classes, `LoginTest.java` and `RegisterTest.java`, would then interact with these Page Objects to perform their respective test scenarios.
*   `LoginTest.java`: Uses `Login.java` to perform login actions and assertions.
*   `RegisterTest.java`: Uses `RegisterPage.java` to perform registration actions and assertions.

### Other Design Patterns

While POM is the most prominent pattern here, other general software design principles and patterns might implicitly be used or could be introduced:

*   **Factory Pattern:** Could be used for creating WebDriver instances (e.g., `WebDriverFactory` to provide Chrome, Firefox, etc., drivers).
*   **Singleton Pattern:** A WebDriver instance could potentially be managed as a Singleton to ensure all tests use the same driver instance (though this has pros and cons in parallel execution).
*   **Builder Pattern:** Could be used for creating complex test data objects (e.g., a `UserBuilder` for creating different types of user accounts for testing).
*   **Strategy Pattern:** Could be applied if there are multiple ways to perform an action (e.g., different login mechanisms) and you want to switch between them dynamically.

By adhering to POM, this project demonstrates good practices for building robust and maintainable automated UI tests.
